//! This crate contains all shared fullstack server functions.
use dioxus::prelude::*;

// Server functions let us define public APIs on the server that can be called like a normal async function from the client.
// Each server function needs to be annotated with the `#[server]` attribute, accept and return serializable types, and return
// a `Result` with the error type [`ServerFnError`].
//
// When the server function is called from the client, it will just serialize the arguments, call the API, and deserialize the
// response.
#[server]
async fn echo_server(input: String) -> Result<String, ServerFnError> {
    // The body of server function like this comment are only included on the server. If you have any server-only logic like
    // database queries, you can put it here. Any imports for the server function should either be imported inside the function
    // or imported under a `#[cfg(feature = "server")]` block.
    Ok(input)
